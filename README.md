I am sorry , I could not find how to create folder to seperate all files, thats why I have them together.
SCRSHT- screenshots are the proves that codes work.
HTML, JS and CSS files are for API website which gives date after input.

CsvFetch

Created class, read the input from csv file, data had a whole line, I used split method to split data  ,
I chose the value 4 as a price, turned string into number, calculated the sum and average, printed out the average.

Converting the tempreture

Created the iput asking user to choose convertion from celsus to fahrengeit or vise versa, 
created variable to save the chose, created temperature and converted temperature variable to print it out later,
for each converting wrote code which calculates fahrenheit to celsus or celcius to fahneheit.
If  the input was wrong, wrote error message.

API

For API I created a webpage which takes input from user , you put any city and tells temperature and weather. 

I used java for all the parts as this is the only language I know. 
I am sure there are other laguages which would save me a lot of time but unfortunatly I didn't have a choice
So I cant say if other languages are better or not.
